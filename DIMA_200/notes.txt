FA21 will have a DIMA 200, I want to start with a group EKO project, just go crazy from day one.  Then move into 360 video, and then......... 

in delivering eko to DIMA 200, many things were lost in translation, students didnt really follow by look at text adventure, for whatever reason they werent into into
they also werent into ELIZA which is weird

i am really happy with how the fears project panned out, 

the student presentations on the readings didnt work out

curriculum topics to for the future digital literacy, social media
