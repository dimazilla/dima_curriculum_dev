# Assignment- Designing an Interactive Narrative with Eko
--- 
**DUE:** April 13th
**NOTE:** If all or part of your group needs to come to campus outside of your regularly scheduled hi-flex meeting time, you may do so ONLY if you coordinate with the me.  

## Description
We have looked at several examples of "text adventure" genre in class, most notably **_Colossal Cave Adventure_** and **_Zork_**, both of which had lasting impacts on the gaming industry.  At its simplest the "text adventure" gives the player a list of options to choose from and enables the characters to perform actions.  By moving through these options the world and characters of the story reveal themselves to the player.  In the past 30-40 years a lot has changed so that now the genre of the "text adventure" has come to feature advanced ways of interacting with the player and using multimedia to expand beyond simple text descriptions.

For this assignment you are being placed into groups of 3-4.  Each group is going to be responsible for writing and excecuting an original game or interactive story in Eko.  While your story can take any form you like it must adhere to following requirments.  Please note that you currently do not know how to accomplish everything that is required of you, but over the next several weeks you will.

## Requirements
* Your story must have three characters, one hero, one villain and one "helper" (from The Heroes Journey).  Only one of these can be the player.
* Your story must adhere to the arc of the Heroes Journey, see the worksheet from **_Distance of the Moon_** for a convenient breakdown
* Your story must have at least one "bad" ending and one "good" ending
* You must customize the style of each button
* Your story must include narration at some point and this narration must be recorded in the sound studio on campus
* Your story must also include "sound design" i.e. sound effects and music in addition to narration and camera sounds
* You must use the OSMO Gimble as demonstrated in class
* You must write a "script" that details character interactions and story elements.  The form of this "script" is up to you, but you might consider drawing a map or diagram of the different branches of the story
* Your project (obviously) must be hosted on Eko

## Some Considerations 
* Games are more enjoyable and replayable if the experience for the player varies from one play to the next.  Consider ways in which you can add random elements, easter eggs or multiple story lines to your  piece.
* Because of the limitations placed on us during the pandemic, you must shoot your project primarily outside.  Any indoor shots must be done by ONLY one person.
* You will be shooting your project in class during your Hi-Flex sessions.  Plan your work, anything you dont finish in class must be finished outside of class time.  Same goes for recording audio.


## Calendar
* Week Nine March 23-26th Gimble Demo & In-Class Shooting
* Week Ten March 20th Work Day (Exporting Video) Note: Campus is Closed April 2nd
* Week Eleven April 6-9th Work Day 
* Week Twelve April 13th Project is Due

## Grading
Your project will be graded purely for completeness and participation.  If you meet all of the requirements listed above your project will be considered complete.  Participation will be assesed by your group members.  Group roles and tasks must be determined by your group.  Failure to fully participate will result in a dimished grade for the individual (not for the entire group).
